# Innoxus

This project empowers you to create a realistic and manageable simulation of your web orchestration using Docker In Docker (DinD) and a user-friendly interface.

Move beyond limitations: Traditional orchestration tools can be complex and inflexible. This platform provides a simulated environment that allows you to:

Experiment and test: Safely explore different configurations and scenarios without impacting your production environment.
Gain insights: Visually monitor and analyze your simulated orchestration to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize performance.
Simplify management: Easily manage your simulated orchestration with an intuitive interface, reducing complexity and overhead.
